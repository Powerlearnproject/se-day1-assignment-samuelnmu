# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematical apply of engineering principles to design, develop,test, and maintain softae systems.
Importance is the ability to produce high quality software that meet user needs and convinience


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Agile Methodologies-enhances customer feedback
The advent of object-it allowed developersto model real world entities
Intodction of structued progamming-Made codes easier


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement-Gather and analyse user needs and system eqirements
Design-Ceate high-level and detailed design
Implementation-write codes and build the softae according to the design specifications
Testing-Veify the software works
Deployment-Release the software to user
Maintenance-Povide ongoing updates and enhancements


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall-its sequential approach with distinct phases like a watefall
Agile-Focuses on flexibility collaboration and responding to change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-Wrriting codes and implementing software solutions
Qality Assurance Engineer-Designing and executing test plans
Project Manager-Oversee the planning, execution and delivering of the softare project


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Versenhancementsion Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for debugging and testing code.
VCS Track changes to code over time, allowing teams to collaborate effectively.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines-Priortize and focus on core features
Technical debt-Code reviews and best practices
Changing reqirements-Adopt Agile Methodologies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-Testing individual components or modules of a software
Integration Testing-Testing interaction between different components of subsystem
System testing-Testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance testing-Testing the software against user reqirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best response from AI
Itsimportant so that yo can get a clear and precise outpt from AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-how to bake a cake
Improved prompt-provide the measurement,sauses, and heat levels of baking a fruitcake
Explanation-The improved prompt is more specific, focusing on a partclar aspect and has clarity
